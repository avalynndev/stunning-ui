This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste to your apps.

What do you mean not a component library?

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries.

## FAQ

::MAccordionItem{title="Why not packaged as a dependency?" value="tab-1"}
The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawback of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation. The design of your components should be separate from their implementation.
